# Pull-api

This project will pull all the stock prices, persist it in some database and stream it to Kafka.

> **_NOTE:_**  Right now, this application is generating random values and streaming them to Kafka,
> when you open http://localhost:8080/stock/prices it will connect to the topic streaming the data via SSE

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```


## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./gradlew build
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `build/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar build/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/pull-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/gradle-tooling.
